Key Notes
    - ingest_all is used to trigger all the other notebooks from one single notebook using dbutils.notebook.run()
    - Variables can be passed during the notebook trigger using dbutils.widgets.text("<variable_name>", "")
    - you can refer to common files using the %run command example : %run "../configuration/config"
    - common functions also can be defined and those can be referred using the same %run command
